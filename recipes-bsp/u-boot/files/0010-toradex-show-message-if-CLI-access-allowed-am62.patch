Subject: [PATCH 10/10] toradex: show message if CLI access allowed (am62)

Before, a message was shown only when the device was closed and the CLI
access was disabled by the CLI protection feature. Now we show a message
also when the device is open which is helpful when someone wants to
ensure the protection is compiled in without having to close the device.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [TorizonCore specific]
