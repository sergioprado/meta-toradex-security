# Enable the Secure Boot hardening of U-Boot by Toradex.
#
# Currently the hardening implementation requires HAB/AHAB to be enabled so that
# the combination TDX_IMX_HAB_ENABLE="0" TDX_UBOOT_HARDENING_ENABLE="1" is not
# valid.
#
# Also the hardening itself is supposed to protect the second link of the chain
# of trust i.e. the link between bootloader and the kernel artifacts. So, the
# combination UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE="0" TDX_UBOOT_HARDENING_ENABLE="1" is not very
# helpful and can prevent the loading of non-FIT images.
#
# Because of the above, we enable the hardening only if both TDX_IMX_HAB_ENABLE
# and UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE are set, by default.
#
TDX_UBOOT_HARDENING_ENABLE ?= "${@'1' if bb.utils.to_boolean(d.getVar('TDX_IMX_HAB_ENABLE')) and bb.utils.to_boolean(d.getVar('UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE')) else '0'}"

# Configure one of the hardening features: the "bootargs protection"; with this
# protection, the fixed part of the kernel command line (boot arguments) are
# saved into the FIT image and checked against the "bootargs" environment
# variable at runtime (by U-Boot).
#
# Notice that the values set below are appropriate for booting Torizon OS only;
# this will be changed in the future.

# TODO: Set TDX_SECBOOT_REQUIRED_BOOTARGS differently based on overrides
# "tdx-signed-bsp" or "tdx-signed-torizon"; the former for booting the BSP reference
# image and the latter for Torizon OS.

# TODO: Use variable OSTREE_KERNEL_ARGS provided by layer meta-toradex-torizon
# to set TDX_SECBOOT_REQUIRED_BOOTARGS for Torizon OS.
