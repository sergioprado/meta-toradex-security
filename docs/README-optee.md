# OP-TEE

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment where the code executed and the data accessed are isolated and protected in terms of confidentiality (no one has access to the data) and integrity (no one can change the code and its behavior).

TEE might be a good solution to store and manage secrets (e.g. encryption keys) and isolate the execution of security-sensitive operations like biometric authentication, digital payments, copyright protection, etc.

[OP-TEE](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/op-tee/) (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) is an open-source TEE designed as a companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on ARM Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology.

This layer provides support for running OP-TEE on the following SoMs:

- Verdin iMX8MP
- Verdin iMX8MM

## Enabling OP-TEE

To enable OP-TEE on the supported hardware platforms, one needs to globally inherit the `tdx-optee` class by adding the following line to an OE configuration file (e.g. `local.conf`):

```
INHERIT += "tdx-optee"
```

A few variables can be used to customize the behavior of this feature:

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------ |
| TDX_OPTEE_DEBUG | Enable OP-TEE debug messages to the serial console (`1` to enable or `0` to disable) | `0` |
| TDX_OPTEE_INSTALL_TESTS | Enable the installation of OP-TEE test applications (`1` to enable or `0` to disable) | `0` |
| TDX_OPTEE_FTPM | Enable support for a firmware TPM (fTPM) implementation running as trusted application in OP-TEE (`1` to enable or `0` to disable). For more information on how an fTPM works, see the next session. | `0` |

## fTPM support in OP-TEE

Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) are designed to enhance system security by performing cryptographic operations such as key generation, encryption, and digital signing. Their primary role is to provide secure storage for cryptographic keys and ensure system integrity by measuring the software environment during the boot process.

An fTPM (Firmware-based Trusted Platform Module) is a type of TPM that operates within firmware, as opposed to being a discrete hardware chip. While it offers similar functionality, it runs inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), such as OP-TEE.

The [fTPM implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/ms-tpm-20-ref) integrated into this layer uses the secure storage API provided by OP-TEE. This secure storage currently saves data in `/data/tee/`, where persistent information such as cryptographic keys and other general-purpose data is securely stored. All stored data is encrypted using a Hardware Unique Key (HUK), which is supplied by the CAAM driver on i.MX platforms.

For further details on how secure storage works in OP-TEE, refer to the [OP-TEE documentation](https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/secure_storage.html).

It's important to note that an fTPM may not entirely replace the need for a discrete TPM chip, as this depends on the specific use case and the product's threat model. Nevertheless, an fTPM can provide adequate security for certain scenarios, especially when incorporating a hardware TPM chip is impractical.

## Read-write filesystem for OP-TEE

OP-TEE needs a read-write filesystem (by default, it writes to `/data/tee/`). When rootfs signature checking is enabled via the `tdxref-signed` class, the rootfs image will be generated using the `dm-verity` kernel feature, which is read-only.

In this case, to provide a read-write filesystem to OP-TEE, the `tdx-tezi-data-partition` class will be automatically inherited. This class will create an additional partition in the eMMC and mount it by default at `/data`. For more information on how this class works, have a look at its documentation ([README-data-partition.md](README-data-partition.md)).

In case your rootfs is read-only and you are not using a Toradex Easy Installer image, make sure the `/data` directory is mounted at a read-write partition, or OP-TEE will not work properly.

## Testing OP-TEE

OP-TEE can be validated using its test applications, which can be installed in the image by adding the following line to an OE configuration file (e.g. `local.conf`):

```
TDX_OPTEE_INSTALL_TESTS += "1"
```

After building with the test applications, a "hello world" application can be used to test the communication between the Normal World (Linux) and the Secure World (OP-TEE):

```
# optee_example_hello_world
```

There is also a complete test suite that can be used to validate OP-TEE:

```
# xtest
```

In case of issues, try enabling debug messages via the `TDX_OPTEE_DEBUG` variable.
