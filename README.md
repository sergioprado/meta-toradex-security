# Supported features and SoMs

This layer supports the following security features:

- Secure boot

The level of support of the above features is:

- Torizon OS (formerly named TorizonCore): tested and integrated.
- BSP Layers and Reference Images: not tested, integration effort is expected.

The features are currently supported on the following SoMs:

- Verdin iMX8MM
- Verdin iMX8MP
- Apalis iMX8
- Colibri iMX8X
- Colibri iMX6ULL (1GB eMMC variant only)
- Colibri iMX7D (1GB eMMC variant only)
- Colibri iMX6DL
- Apalis iMX6

This layer only works on Embedded Linux 6.3.0 and newer releases.

# Secure boot

To enable secure boot, the `tdx-signed-bsp` class needs to be inherited in a configuration file.

```
INHERIT += "tdx-signed-bsp"
```

When secure boot is enabled:

- The bootloader image is signed at build time and its signature is verified at runtime using i.MX HAB/AHAB.
- A FIT image with the kernel and its artifacts (device trees, ramdisk, etc) is signed at build time and its signature is verified at runtime by the bootloader.

## Configuring HAB/AHAB support

When the `tdx-signed-bsp` class is inherited, signing bootloader images via HAB/AHAB is enabled by default. Set `TDX_IMX_HAB_ENABLE` to `0` to disable it.

Before using this feature, it is required to:

1. Download NXP CST tool from https://www.nxp.com/webapp/sps/download/license.jsp?colCode=IMX_CST_TOOL_NEW.
2. Follow the NXP documentation to generate the keys, certificates, SRK tables and Efuse Hash (the documentation can be found inside the CST tool in `docs/CST_UG.pdf`); be sure to take note of your answers to the key generation script.

After that, configure the various variables listed below to match your choices; pay special attention to the ones depending on your answers to the NXP key generation script.

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------ |
| `TDX_IMX_HAB_ENABLE` | Enable/disable HAB/AHAB support; allowed values: `0` or `1`. | `1` |
| `TDX_IMX_HAB_CST_DIR` | Location of the CST tool. | `${TOPDIR}/keys/cst` |
| `TDX_IMX_HAB_CST_CERTS_DIR` | Location of the certificates directory. The associated private keys must be located in a directory called `keys` at the same level as the `crts` directory (this is a requirement for the CST tool to work properly). | `${TDX_IMX_HAB_CST_DIR}/crts` |
| `TDX_IMX_HAB_CST_CRYPTO` | Type of cryptographic keys in use; allowed values: `rsa` or `ecdsa`. This should be set to `ecdsa` if (and only if) you selected "Elliptic Curve Cryptography" when generating the keys/certificates with the CST tool. | `rsa` |
| `TDX_IMX_HAB_CST_KEY_SIZE` | For **RSA** keys, this would be the key length (in bits) as entered into the CST tool. For **ECDSA**, this would be a string determined from the generated certificate file name; for example, for a file named `SRK1_sha256_secp384r1_v3_ca_crt.pem` (found in the certificates directory) the present variable would be set to `secp384r1`. | `2048` |
| `TDX_IMX_HAB_CST_DIG_ALGO` | Digest algorithm as entered into the CST tool. | `sha256` |
| `TDX_IMX_HAB_CST_SRK_CA` | Whether or not the SRK certificates have the CA flag set as entered into the CST tool; allowed values: `0` or `1`. | `1` |

The complete list of variables can be found in the `imx-hab.bbclass` file.

### Known issues

- On devices based on the NXP i.MX6 and i.MX7 SoCs, `TDX_IMX_HAB_CST_SRK_CA` must be set to `1` and the SRK certificates must be generated with the CA flag set. Build errors will happen if the variable is set to `0` because the signing logic currently unconditionally tries to use the CSF and IMG certificates which are not generated by CST when the CA flag is not set.

### Closing the device

If HAB/AHAB is enabled, in the end of the build, a file with the commands to fuse the SoC (`fuse-cmds.txt`) will be generated in the images directory. The commands in this file should be executed in the U-Boot command line interface.

Read the warning messages carefully and be aware that the commands will write to One-Time Programmable e-fuses, and once you write them, you can't go back! You can check for HAB events with the command `hab_status` for HAB or `ahab_status` for AHAB. It is recommended to read NXP documentation about HAB/AHAB before writing to the e-fuses. This is an output example of the `fuse-cmds.txt` file:

```
$ cat deploy/images/verdin-imx8mp/fuse-cmds.txt
# These are One-Time Programmable e-fuses. Once you write them you can't
# go back, so get it right the first time!
fuse prog -y 6 0 0x8AE322B2
fuse prog -y 6 1 0xDF2939A3
fuse prog -y 6 2 0x9DA80323
fuse prog -y 6 3 0x3B024EF2
fuse prog -y 7 0 0xA53091
fuse prog -y 7 1 0x55304E7A
fuse prog -y 7 2 0xFB8FF259
fuse prog -y 7 3 0x9CE57582

# After the device successfully boots a signed image without generating
# any HAB events, it is safe to secure, or 'close', the device. This is
# the last step in the process. Once the fuse is blown, the chip does
# not load an image that has not been signed using the correct PKI tree.
# Be careful! This is again a One-Time Programmable e-fuse. Once you
# write it you can't go back, so get it right the first time. If
# anything in the previous steps wasn't done correctly, after writing
# this bit, the SOM will not boot anymore!
fuse prog -y 1 3 0x02000000
```

## U-Boot hardening

Toradex is implementing various changes to U-Boot (currently as a series of patches) with the purpose of hardening it for secure boot. The hardening includes the following features:

- **Command whitelisting**: this part of the hardening is responsible for limiting the set of commands available to boot scripts once the device is in closed state - by default, only a small set of commands remain available in that state (mostly those strictly required for booting a secure boot image) alongside a few others considered strictly secure and potentially useful for future boot scripts.
- **Protection against execution of unsigned software by** `bootm`: for securely booting secure boot images the "bootm" command is used in the boot scripts, but this command can also be used insecurely; this part of the hardening tries to ensure only the secure use of the command is possible so that the only possible code path at runtime is that for booting from signed FIT images.
- **CLI access prevention**: this is an extra safeguard whereby the access to the U-Boot CLI gets disabled once the device is in closed state; this is what happens by default (but can be overridden).
- **Kernel command-line protection**: normally U-Boot passes the contents of its environment variable `bootargs` directly to the Linux kernel and this variable in turn has its value set in the persistent U-Boot environment or it is dynamically built by the boot scripts (with Torizon OS following the latter approach) - either way, it is a vector of attack; to prevent tampering of `bootargs` the present protection causes the build to store a copy of the "expected" kernel arguments inside the (signed) FIT image and a related patch to U-Boot to check `bootargs` against that copy at runtime, possibly stopping the boot process in case of a mismatch.

The hardening features above are controlled by the following variables:

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------ |
| `TDX_UBOOT_HARDENING_ENABLE` | Enable hardening features as a whole | `1` if both `TDX_IMX_HAB_ENABLE` and `UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE` are set or 0 otherwise |
| `TDX_SECBOOT_REQUIRED_BOOTARGS` | Expected value for the fixed part of the kernel command line | Different value for each machine (suitable for Torizon OS) |

The behavior of the different hardening features can be set via the control FDT (see [Devicetree Control in U-Boot](https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/develop/devicetree/control.html)). Setting the control FDT at build time can be achieved by adding extra device-tree [.dtsi fragments](https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/develop/devicetree/control.html#external-dtsi-fragments) to U-Boot and setting the Kconfig variable `CONFIG_DEVICE_TREE_INCLUDES` appropriately; with Yocto/OE this would normally involve adding small patches to U-Boot and appending changes to its recipe but the details are outside the scope of the present document.

The following device-tree fragment shows all the nodes and properties that can be present in the control FDT:

```
/ {
    chosen {
        toradex,secure-boot {          /* if not present: disable Toradex hardening at runtime */
            disabled;                  /* if present: disable Toradex hardening at runtime */
            enable-cli-when-closed;    /* if present: keep u-boot CLI enabled when device is closed */
            bootloader-commands {
                allow-open = <...>;    /* list of command categories allowed when device is open */
                allow-closed = <...>;  /* list of command categories allowed when device is closed */
                deny-open = <...>;     /* list of command categories denied when device is open (use is discouraged) */
                deny-closed = <...>;   /* list of command categories denied when device is closed (use is discouraged) */
                needed = <...>         /* list of command categories strictly needed to boot (use is discouraged) */
            };
        };
    };
};
```

The command categories are currently only available as part of a [patch](./recipes-bsp/u-boot/files/0001-toradex-common-add-command-whitelisting-modules.patch) in header `cmd-categories.h`. The default FDT is part of another [patch](./recipes-bsp/u-boot/files/0002-toradex-dts-add-fragment-file-to-configure-secure-bo.patch) in file `tdx-secboot.dtsi`.

<!-- TODO: Make more user-friendly instructions on setting the control FDT. -->

## Configuring FIT image signing

When the `tdx-signed-bsp` class is inherited, generating and signing a FIT image is enabled by default. Set `UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE` to `0` to disable it.

This features uses the default FIT image signing support provided by the `uboot-sign` and `kernel-fitimage` classes from OpenEmbedded Core. See the [Yocto Project documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/classes.html#kernel-fitimage) for more details.

A few variables can be used to configure this feature, including:

| Variable | Description | Default value |
| :------- | :---------- | :------------ |
| `UBOOT_SIGN_ENABLE` | Enable signing of FIT image | `1` |
| `FIT_GENERATE_KEYS` | Generate signing keys | `1` |
| `UBOOT_SIGN_KEYDIR` | Location of the RSA key and certificate used for signing | `${TOPDIR}/keys/fit` |
| `UBOOT_SIGN_KEYNAME` | The name of the key used for signing | `dev` |

The complete list of variables can be found in the `tdx-signed-fit-image.inc` file.
